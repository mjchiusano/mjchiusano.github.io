<p class="gutter-pad-bottom">“Chiusano gives a voice to the lesser-known Brooklyn neighborhood of Marine Park in his collection of interconnected stories that unearth broader truths among quotidian events, from haircuts to train rides.”<br>
—The Huffington Post</p>

<p class="gutter-pad-bottom">“In clean, honed prose, Mark Chiusano gives us an intimate tour of a neighborhood of Brooklyn not offered up in fiction before.  His explorations of loyalty within a family, and the breach of it, are startling and affecting—his sense of story is impeccable.  Marine Park is a debut worth a reader’s close attention.” <br>
—Amy Hempel, author of The Collected Stories of Amy Hempel </p>

<p class="gutter-pad-bottom">“The stories in <i>Marine Park</i> are funny and touching and elliptical, and all about coming of age at the edge of the city and on the margins of the good life, with some moving forward and others left behind. Mark Chiusano is wonderful on how our minds can be elsewhere even when we wish to be wholly present, and on the oblique ways in which we therefore often have to signal our indispensability to one another.<br> 
—Jim Shepard, author of You Think That's Bad </p>

 <p class="gutter-pad-bottom">“One of the most subtle, tender, emotionally powerful books that I’ve read in a long time. Set mostly in Brooklyn, but its subject is the whole of America. If you’ve never been to Marine Park before, by the end of this collection you’ll feel like you’d lived there your whole life. This is a stunning debut.” <br>
—Saïd Sayrafiezadeh, author of When Skateboards Will Be Free and Brief Encounters with the Enemy </p>

<p class="gutter-pad-bottom">“Here's the spirit of dear Sherwood Anderson in Mark Chiusano’s Marine Park, another village brimming with all of the odd drama of families and loners. There is something a little old and wise in this talented writer’s debut. At times the stories read like the news, letters from a friend, and at times the tales seem elegiac glimpses of a lost world. Mr. Chiusano is writing family from the inside out and he makes this world an aching bittersweet pleasure. Here is the kind of affectionate particularity which marks a fine writer.” <br>
—Ron Carlson, author of Return to Oakpine </p>

<p class="gutter-pad-bottom">“In Marine Park, Mark Chiusano shines a light on lives that are too often left in the dark.  He shows us, with humor and deep-hearted compassion, the complexities of growing up and growing old in the blue collar shadows, and he gives us, story after story, the chance to see ourselves in his longing, hopeful characters. This is a wise and affecting collection, and it marks the arrival of a voice we’ve not heard until now, one that will carry through the streets and alleys of contemporary literature for years to come.” <br>
—Bret Anthony Johnston, author of Remember Me Like This </p>
 
<p class="gutter-pad-bottom">“Memo to booksellers: Avoid calling Mark Chiusano a ‘fresh voice in American lit.’ Chiusano’s voice isn’t fresh. It is knowing. Also: Piercing; clean; engaging; and wise. Use those words. Feel free to compare Chiusano to other young writers (Claire Vaye Watkins, Leslie Jamison) but comparisons to Junot Diaz and John Cheever are also accurate. Talk about how <i>Marine Park</i> documents the Brooklyn neighborhood that is its namesake, examining the grit without disparagement and always preserving the residents’ humanity. But assure potential readers that local knowledge isn’t a prerequisite. In the end, the book’s specificity of location is the device Chiusano uses to better show us ourselves. Alternatively, offer potential readers a chair. Invite them to sit and read one of the stories. <i>Marine Park</i> will then sell itself.”<br>
